  <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6"><div class="parent-div"><div class="child-div">Solid</div>A solidâ€™s particles are packed closely together. The forces between the particles are strong enough that the particles cannot move freely; they can only vibrate. As a result, a solid has a stable, definite shape and a definite volume. Solids can only change shape under force, as when broken or cut.</div></div>
  <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6"><div class="parent-div"><div class="child-div">Liquid</div>A liquid is a fluid that conforms to the shape of its container but that retains a nearly constant volume independent of pressure. The volume is definite (does not change) if the temperature and pressure are constant. When a solid is heated above its melting point, it becomes liquid because the pressure is higher than the triple point of the substance.</div></div>
  <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-12"><div class="parent-div"><div class="child-div">Gas</div>Gas molecules have either very weak bonds or no bonds at all, so they can move freely and quickly. Because of this, not only will a gas conform to the shape of its container, it will also expand to completely fill the container. Gas molecules have enough kinetic energy that the effect of intermolecular forces is small (or zero, for an ideal gas).</div></div>
